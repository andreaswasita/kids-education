# 🎯 Career Pathways — Medicine, Mathematics & Technology

> Building toward future careers in medicine, mathematics, or technology. These pathways share common foundations that start in primary school.

---

## Shared Foundation Skills

All three pathways require:
- **Strong analytical thinking** — logic, reasoning, problem-solving
- **Mathematical proficiency** — from arithmetic through to advanced math
- **Reading comprehension** — absorbing and analysing complex information
- **Discipline and persistence** — long-term focus and dedication
- **Curiosity** — genuine interest in how things work

These are exactly what the selective school pathway develops.
