## Stage 1: Pre-Reader (Current Stage — Age 5)

### The Science of Reading

Research overwhelmingly supports **systematic synthetic phonics** as the most effective method for teaching reading. This approach:
1. Teaches individual letter **sounds** (phonemes)
2. Teaches how to **blend** sounds together
3. Uses **decodable texts** (books using only taught sounds)
4. Gradually introduces more complex letter patterns

### What NOT to Do
- Don't rely on "whole language" or "three cueing" methods (looking at pictures to guess words)
- Don't teach letter names before letter sounds
- Don't skip the phonics stage — even bright children need this foundation

### Phonics Programs (Choose One)

| Program | Format | Cost | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| **Jolly Phonics** | Workbook + songs | ~$30 | Most popular worldwide, excellent |
| **Little Learners Love Literacy** | Program + books | ~$100+ | Australian-developed, outstanding |
| **Letters and Sounds** (UK Gov) | Free PDF online | FREE | Systematic, well-structured |
| **Reading Eggs** | App/Web | ~$90/yr | Interactive, engaging for kids |
| **Sounds-Write** | Program | Via school | Increasingly adopted in NSW schools |

### First Books to Read

| Book Series | Level | When to Start |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Bob Books Set 1 | Pre-reader | After 8-12 letter sounds |
| Dandelion Readers Level 1 | Very early | After 12 letter sounds |
| Little Learners Stage 1 | Very early | After 12 letter sounds |
| Jolly Phonics Readers | Early | Alongside phonics program |

## Stage 2: Emergent Reader (Age 5-6)

### Building Sight Word Knowledge

High-frequency words that appear in most texts. Learn 10 per week:

**First 50 sight words (Oxford/Dolch combined):**
```
the, a, is, it, in, I, to, and, he, was
my, of, we, on, at, no, do, go, so, up
me, an, am, if, or, as, be, by, us, has
had, him, his, her, she, are, not, but, you, all
can, did, get, got, has, had, let, put, ran, will
```

### Building Fluency

| Activity | How | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Repeated reading | Read same book 3+ times | Builds speed and confidence |
| Paired reading | Parent and child alternate pages | Models fluent reading |
| Whisper reading | Child reads quietly while parent listens | Low-pressure practice |
| Audio + book | Listen to audiobook while following text | Connects sound to print |

## Stage 3: Early Reader (Age 6-7)

### Transitioning to Chapter Books

Signs of readiness:
- Reads levelled readers fluently (PM Level 15+)
- Doesn't need to sound out every word
- Can discuss what happened in a story
- Shows interest in longer stories

### Recommended Transition Books

| Title | Author | Why It Works |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| *Elephant & Piggie* series | Mo Willems | Dialogue-driven, hilarious, short |
| *Fly Guy* series | Tedd Arnold | Short chapters, funny, easy |
| *Owl Diaries* | Rebecca Elliott | Cute, diary format, gentle |
| *Dragon Masters* | Tracey West | Adventure, short chapters |
| *Mercy Watson* | Kate DiCamillo | Funny, great language |

## Stage 4: Fluent Reader (Age 7-8)

### The "Matthew Effect" in Reading

Research shows that children who read more, get better, which makes them read more, which makes them even better. This positive cycle is why **volume of reading** is so important.

**Target:** Read 20+ minutes per day independently.

### Building Vocabulary

| Strategy | How | Details |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Read widely** | Fiction + non-fiction | Exposure to diverse vocabulary |
| **Word consciousness** | Point out interesting words | "Treacherous — that means dangerous and unpredictable" |
| **Context clues** | Teach how to figure out unknown words | Use surrounding sentences as clues |
| **Word families** | Group related words | act, action, active, activity, react, interact |
| **Word wall** | Display new words at home | Write on sticky notes, add to a wall |

### Comprehension Strategies

The "Fab 7" comprehension strategies (teach explicitly):
1. **Predicting** — "What do you think will happen?"
2. **Questioning** — "What are you wondering?"
3. **Clarifying** — "What word/part was confusing?"
4. **Summarising** — "Tell me in 2-3 sentences what happened"
5. **Connecting** — "Does this connect to anything you know?"
6. **Visualising** — "What did you picture in your mind?"
7. **Inferring** — "What does the text suggest without saying directly?"

## Stage 5: Advanced Reader (Age 8-10) — OC Test Level

### Reading Comprehension for Testing

OC test reading questions test:
- **Literal understanding** (15%) — Facts stated directly in the text
- **Inferential understanding** (60%) — Meaning implied but not stated
- **Evaluative understanding** (25%) — Judging, analysing, critiquing

### Types of Test Questions

| Question Type | Example | Strategy |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Main idea | "What is this passage mainly about?" | Summarise each paragraph in your mind |
| Vocabulary in context | "The word 'luminous' most likely means..." | Re-read the sentence, try each option |
| Inference | "Based on the passage, the character probably feels..." | Look for clues in dialogue and actions |
| Author's purpose | "Why did the author include this paragraph?" | Think about what it adds to the text |
| Text structure | "How is this text organised?" | Look for signal words (first, however, because) |
| Detail | "According to the passage, which statement is true?" | Scan for the specific information |

### Comprehension Practice Resources

| Resource | Type | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| **Excel OC/Selective Reading** | Workbook | ~$20 |
| **IXL Year 4-6 Reading** | Online | ~$120/yr |
| **Reading Comprehension Strategies (worksheet books)** | Workbook | ~$15 |
| **CommonLit** | Online passages + questions | FREE |
| **Newsela** | Levelled news articles | FREE tier |

## Stage 6: Analytical Reader (Age 10-12) — Selective Test Level

### Higher-Order Reading Skills

| Skill | What It Means | How to Practice |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Critical analysis** | Evaluate arguments and evidence | Read editorials, discuss "Do you agree?" |
| **Synthesis** | Combine information from multiple sources | Read 2 articles on same topic, compare |
| **Author's craft** | How writing techniques create effect | "Why did the author use short sentences here?" |
| **Perspective** | Understanding multiple viewpoints | "How would this story be different from another character's perspective?" |
| **Evaluation** | Judging quality and reliability | "Is this source trustworthy? How do you know?" |
