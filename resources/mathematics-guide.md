## Core Philosophy: Singapore Math Approach

### Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract (CPA)

The world's highest-performing maths students (Singapore, Japan, South Korea) learn through CPA:

1. **Concrete** — Use physical objects (blocks, counters, rods)
2. **Pictorial** — Draw diagrams, bar models, number lines
3. **Abstract** — Use numbers and symbols

**Example: Teaching 13 - 7**
- **Concrete:** Start with 13 blocks. Take away 7. Count what's left.
- **Pictorial:** Draw 13 dots. Cross out 7. Count remaining.
- **Abstract:** 13 - 7 = 6

### Bar Model Method (Singapore)

The bar model is the most powerful problem-solving tool in primary maths:

```
Problem: Tom has 45 marbles. He gives 18 to Sam. How many does Tom have left?

[------ 45 marbles total -------]
[-- 18 given away --][--- ? ---]

45 - 18 = 27 marbles
```

```
Problem: A shop sold 35 red apples and 28 green apples. How many in total?

[-- 35 red ---][-- 28 green --]
[----------- ? total ----------]

35 + 28 = 63 apples
```

Teach this method early — it works all the way through to algebra.

## Stage-by-Stage Detail

### Stage 1: Number Sense (Age 5, Kindy)

**Key concepts:**
- Counting to 100 (forward and backward from 20)
- Recognise numbers 0-20
- More than / less than
- Basic 2D shapes
- Simple patterns
- Addition within 10 using objects

**Activities:**
| Activity | How Often | Details |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Count everything | Daily | Stairs, grapes, toys |
| Number recognition games | Daily | Flash cards, magnets on fridge |
| Shape hunts | Weekly | "Find all the rectangles in this room" |
| Pattern making | 2-3x/week | Beads, blocks, stickers |
| Cooking with measuring | Weekly | Cups, spoons, scales |

---

### Stage 2: Operations (Age 6, Year 1)

**Key concepts:**
- Addition and subtraction facts to 20 (memorise)
- Number bonds to 10 (most critical skill)
- Place value: tens and ones
- Skip counting by 2s, 5s, 10s
- Simple word problems
- Half and quarter concepts

**Number Bonds to 10 — The Foundation of All Computation:**
```
0 + 10 = 10
1 + 9  = 10
2 + 8  = 10
3 + 7  = 10
4 + 6  = 10
5 + 5  = 10
```

These must be AUTOMATIC. Practice daily until instant recall.

### Stage 3: Fluency (Age 7, Year 2)

**Key concepts:**
- Times tables (start with 2, 5, 10, then 3, 4, then all)
- Multi-digit addition and subtraction with regrouping
- Introduction to multiplication as "groups of"
- Division as "sharing equally"
- Fractions: ½, ¼, ⅓ with visual models
- Time to 5-minute intervals
- Australian money

**Times Table Mastery Order:**
```
Priority 1: 2×, 5×, 10× (easy patterns, build confidence)
Priority 2: 4×, 3×      (4× is double 2×, 3× has patterns)
Priority 3: 6×, 8×      (use known facts: 6×7 = 5×7 + 1×7)
Priority 4: 7×, 9×      (hardest — 9× finger trick helps)
Priority 5: 11×, 12×    (by this point, most are known)
```

### Stage 4: Problem Solving (Age 8, Year 3)

**Key concepts:**
- All times tables to 12×12 automatic
- Long multiplication (2-digit × 1-digit)
- Division with remainders
- Fractions: comparing, ordering, equivalent fractions
- Decimals: tenths
- Area and perimeter
- Data: read and create graphs
- Multi-step word problems

**Word Problem Types to Master:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Join** | Sam had 23 cards. He got 17 more. How many now? |
| **Separate** | There were 45 birds. 18 flew away. How many left? |
| **Compare** | Ali is 132cm tall. Ben is 145cm. How much taller is Ben? |
| **Equal groups** | 5 bags with 8 lollies each. How many total? |
| **Array** | 4 rows of 6 chairs. How many chairs? |
| **Two-step** | 24 red flowers and 18 yellow flowers in 6 vases equally. How many per vase? |

- Algebraic thinking (find the missing number)

**OC-Style Question Examples:**

1. *A train leaves at 9:47 AM and arrives at 11:23 AM. How long is the journey?*
2. *If 3/8 of the 48 students are girls, how many boys are there?*
3. *A number pattern goes: 5, 8, 14, 23, ___. What is the next number?*
4. *A rectangle has a perimeter of 36cm. Its length is twice its width. What is its area?*

## 💡 Parent Quick Tips

1. **Never say "I'm bad at maths"** — Growth mindset starts with you
2. **Use maths daily** — Cooking, shopping, travel, sports scores
3. **Ask "How did you work that out?"** — The process matters more than the answer
4. **Celebrate mistakes** — "That's interesting! Let's figure out where it went wrong"
5. **Make estimation a game** — "How many jelly beans in the jar?" "How long until we arrive?"
6. **Connect maths to interests** — Sports statistics, Minecraft coordinates, LEGO dimensions
7. **Consistency beats intensity** — 15 minutes daily > 2 hours on Saturday
