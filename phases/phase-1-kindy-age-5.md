## 📖 The Science of Reading — How to Teach a 5-Year-Old to Read

The research is clear: **systematic synthetic phonics** is the most effective method.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### Month 1-2: Letter Sounds (NOT letter names)
**The biggest mistake:** Teaching "A, B, C" before "ah, buh, cuh". Letter sounds unlock reading; letter names come later.

**How to teach:**
1. Start with the most useful letters first: **s, a, t, p, i, n** (these make many words)
2. Teach 2-3 new sounds per week
3. Use multisensory methods:
   - **See it:** Show the letter on a card
   - **Say it:** Make the sound together
   - **Trace it:** Write it in sand, shaving cream, or with finger paint
   - **Find it:** Spot the letter in books, signs, cereal boxes

**Order to teach letter sounds:**
```
Group 1: s, a, t, p
Group 2: i, n, m, d
Group 3: g, o, c, k
Group 4: e, u, r
Group 5: h, b, f, l
Group 6: j, v, w, x, y, z
Group 7: sh, ch, th, ck (digraphs — 2 letters, 1 sound)
```

#### Month 2-3: Blending
Once he knows ~8 letter sounds, start blending:
- **s-a-t** → sat
- **t-a-p** → tap  
- **p-i-n** → pin

**Technique:** Point to each letter, say each sound slowly, then "push" them together faster and faster.

#### Month 3-6: Decodable Books
Move to decodable readers (books where every word can be sounded out with known letters):
- **Dandelion Readers** (UK, excellent phonics sequence)
- **Bob Books** (US, very popular)
- **Little Learners Love Literacy** (Australian!)
- **Jolly Phonics readers**

#### Month 6-12: Build Fluency
- Re-read favourite decodable books for fluency
- Introduce sight words (words that can't be easily sounded out)
- Begin levelled readers (PM Readers, Oxford Reading Tree)

### Daily Reading Routine (15-20 min total)

| Activity | Duration | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Phonics practice | 5 min | Letter sounds, blending activities |
| Read-aloud (parent reads) | 10 min | Rich, interesting stories above reading level |
| Attempt reading (child reads) | 5 min | Decodable books at child's level |

## 🔢 Building Number Sense

### Proven Approach: Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract (CPA)

This is the **Singapore Math** methodology, used by the world's highest-performing maths students.

#### Concrete (use real objects)
- Count blocks, toys, fruit, stairs
- "Give me 7 blocks" / "How many grapes are on your plate?"
- Use fingers for addition

#### Pictorial (use pictures/drawings)
- Draw dots to represent numbers
- Use number lines on paper
- Colour-in counting worksheets

#### Abstract (use numbers)
- Recognise written numerals
- Write numbers
- Simple number sentences: 3 + 2 = 5

### Key Activities

| Activity | How Often | Tools |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Counting everyday objects | Daily | Anything! |
| Number recognition games | 3x/week | Flash cards, magnets |
| Shape hunts around the house | 1x/week | Your home |
| Pattern making with blocks | 2x/week | Duplo, blocks |
| Board games with dice/spinners | Weekend | Snakes & Ladders, etc. |
| Cooking together (measuring) | Weekend | Kitchen scales, cups |

### Recommended Games for Number Sense

| Game | Why It's Great | Cost |
|------|---------------|------|
| **Snakes & Ladders** | Counting, number recognition | ~$10 |
| **Hi Ho Cherry-O** | Counting, addition, subtraction | ~$15 |
| **UNO** | Number recognition, matching | ~$8 |
| **Shut the Box** | Addition, strategy | ~$15 |
| **Sequence Numbers** | Number recognition, strategy | ~$20 |
| **Monopoly Junior** | Counting money, simple maths | ~$20 |

## 🧠 Building Thinking Skills

At age 5, thinking skills development happens naturally through:

### Puzzles
- Start with 24-piece puzzles, work up to 48-100 pieces
- Jigsaw puzzles build spatial reasoning (critical for OC test)

### Building & Construction
- **LEGO/Duplo** — following instructions AND free building
- **Magna-Tiles** — geometry and spatial awareness
- **Tangrams** — shape recognition and spatial reasoning

### Pattern Activities
- Bead threading in patterns (red-blue-red-blue)
- Pattern blocks and cards
- "What comes next?" games

### Logic & Reasoning Games
| Game | Skill | Age Range |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Rush Hour Jr.** | Logical thinking | 5+ |
| **ThinkFun Zingo** | Pattern matching, speed | 4+ |
| **Spot It!/Dobble** | Visual perception | 5+ |
| **Blokus** | Spatial reasoning, strategy | 5+ |
| **Guess Who?** | Logical elimination | 5+ |

## 💡 Parent Tips for Age 5

### Do's ✅
- **Read aloud every day** — this is the single most impactful thing you can do
- **Make it fun** — games, songs, stories, not worksheets every day
- **Talk constantly** — describe what you see, ask questions, expand vocabulary
- **Praise effort**, not intelligence ("You worked hard!" not "You're so smart!")
- **Let him struggle** a little — productive struggle builds resilience
- **Visit the library** weekly — let him choose books
- **Play board games** — mathematical thinking, turn-taking, strategy
- **Be patient with reading** — going from zero to reading takes 6-12 months
- **Celebrate small wins** — reading his first word is a HUGE milestone

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't compare to other children
- Don't push too hard — if he's frustrated, take a break
- Don't skip phonics for "whole language" guessing
- Don't over-schedule — free play is critical for brain development
- Don't make reading feel like punishment
- Don't use screens as a babysitter — educational apps need parent involvement at this age
