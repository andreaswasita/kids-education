## 🗓️ Preparation Schedule (Jan-May)

### Weekday Schedule (45-60 min total)
```
4:00 PM - Reading comprehension passage (15 min)
4:15 PM - Maths reasoning problems (15 min)  
4:30 PM - Thinking skills practice (15 min)
         OR
4:00 PM - Full practice test section (30-40 min) + review (15 min)
```

### Weekend Schedule (60-90 min, split AM/PM)
```
Morning  - Full practice test OR 2 sections (45 min)
         - Review mistakes thoroughly (15 min)
Afternoon - Wide reading for pleasure (30 min)
         - Educational games, chess, puzzles (30 min)
```

### Key Principle: Quality Over Quantity

**AVOID** doing 10 practice papers per week mechanically.  
**DO** complete 2-3 practice papers per week with **thorough review** of every mistake.

For every mistake, ask:
1. **Why** did I get this wrong?
2. **What** should I have done?
3. **How** will I recognise this type of question next time?

## 🧠 Thinking Skills Preparation

### This is Often the Differentiator

Many children can read well and do maths. Thinking Skills is where the OC test separates top candidates.

### Question Types to Master

#### 1. Pattern Matrices (Very Common)
A 3×3 grid with 8 shapes/symbols and one missing. Identify the pattern across rows AND columns.

**Practice method:** Start with 2×2 matrices, then 3×3. Talk through the logic: "What changes across each row?"

#### 2. Spatial Reasoning
- Paper folding → punch hole → unfold → where are the holes?
- Mirror reflections of shapes
- Which net folds into this 3D shape?
- How many blocks in this 3D figure?

#### 3. Number Sequences
- Arithmetic sequences: 3, 7, 11, 15, ___
- Geometric sequences: 2, 6, 18, ___
- Two-operation: ×2 then +1: 3, 7, 15, 31, ___
- Letter-number codes

#### 4. Verbal/Abstract Analogies
- "Book is to reading as fork is to ___"
- Picture analogies (shape relationships)

#### 5. Logical Deduction
- "If A > B and B > C, then..."
- "Three children are in a race. Tom finished before Sue. Sue finished before Max. Who came second?"

## 🏋️ Practice Test Strategy

### Month-by-Month Plan

#### January: Diagnostic Phase
- Complete 1 full OC practice test (timed, under test conditions)
- Score it. Identify the weakest area
- Create a targeted study plan based on results

#### February: Build Weaknesses
- 2 practice test sections per week (focus on weak areas)
- Daily skill-building exercises  
- Continue wide reading

#### March: Full Tests Begin
- 1 full timed practice test per week (Saturday morning)
- Review all errors the same day
- Track scores — look for improvement trends
- Mid-week: targeted practice on persistent weak areas

#### April: Peak Preparation
- 1-2 full timed practice tests per week
- Focus on **speed AND accuracy**
- Practice the "skip and return" strategy
- Work on managing test anxiety
- Last 2 weeks: reduce intensity, consolidate confidence

#### May (Pre-Test Week): Wind Down
- **No heavy study in the last 3-4 days before the test**
- Light review only
- Early bedtimes, good nutrition
- Positive conversation — "You've prepared well, just do your best"
- Test day: good breakfast, arrive early, bring all required materials

## 🧘 Managing Test Anxiety

### For the Child
- **Normalise testing** — "It's just a way to show what you know"
- **Reframe pressure** — "OC is one option. Great schools exist everywhere."
- **Practice mindfulness** — Simple breathing exercises before practice tests
- **Physical activity** — Exercise reduces anxiety. Keep sport/outdoor play in the schedule.
- **Sleep** — 10+ hours per night is crucial for an 8-9 year old brain

### For the Parent
- Don't project your anxiety onto the child
- Don't over-discuss the test significance
- Focus on the **process** (learning, growing) not the **outcome** (getting in)
- Have a "Plan B" conversation — selective school is not the only path to success
- Remember: James Ruse isn't the only path to medicine/maths/technology

## 📊 After the OC Test (May-December)

### If Offered a Place:
- Celebrate! Then shift focus to continued learning
- Prepare for the transition to OC class
- Continue building skills — OC classes move fast

### If Placed on Reserve or Unsuccessful:
- **This is NOT failure.** 15,000+ students apply for ~1,800 places
- The skills built are permanent and will help in Year 5-6
- Focus shifts to Selective High School test preparation (Phase 6)
- Many successful Selective school students were NOT in OC classes
- Consider private school scholarship tests as additional options

### Regardless of Outcome:
Continue developing across all areas:
- [ ] Read increasingly complex novels
- [ ] Advance mathematical skills to Year 5-6 level
- [ ] Maintain thinking skills practice (1-2 sessions/week)
- [ ] Enter competitions: ICAS, AMC, spelling bees
- [ ] Continue chess, coding, music
- [ ] Introduce Python basics (age 9-10 is ideal to start text-based coding)
