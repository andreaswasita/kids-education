## 📖 Reading Progression

### Consolidate Phonics (Term 1-2)

By now, basic phonics should be in place. Year 1 is about:

1. **Long vowel sounds:** a-e (cake), i-e (bike), o-e (home), u-e (cute), ee (tree), ea (bead)
2. **Vowel teams:** ai/ay (rain/play), oi/oy (coin/boy), ou/ow (cloud/cow)
3. **R-controlled vowels:** ar (car), er (her), ir (bird), or (fork), ur (burn)
4. **Silent letters:** kn (know), wr (write), gn (gnaw)

### Reading Fluency Building

| Strategy | How | Frequency |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| **Re-reading** | Read same book 3 times for fluency | Daily |
| **Paired reading** | Child reads one page, parent reads next | Daily |
| **Timed reading** | 1-minute reading sprints (gentle, fun) | 3x/week |
| **Expression practice** | Read with character voices | Daily |
| **Audio books + physical book** | Listen while following along | 2x/week |

### Book Level Progression (Year 1)

| Term | PM Level | Reading Recovery | Example Books |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Term 1 | 5-8 | 7-12 | Simple patterned texts |
| Term 2 | 9-12 | 13-16 | Short stories, multiple sentences per page |
| Term 3 | 13-16 | 17-20 | Longer stories, varied sentence structure |
| Term 4 | 17-20 | 21-24 | Early chapter books, simple plots |

### Recommended Reading Series (Year 1)

## 🔢 Mathematics Development

### Number Facts Mastery

**Critical goal:** Automatic recall of addition/subtraction facts to 20.

#### Strategies to Teach (in order)

1. **Counting on** — Start at the bigger number: 8 + 3 = start at 8, count 9, 10, 11
2. **Number bonds to 10** — The most important maths fact set:
   ```
   1+9  2+8  3+7  4+6  5+5
   ```
3. **Doubles** — 1+1, 2+2, 3+3, 4+4, 5+5, 6+6, 7+7, 8+8, 9+9, 10+10
4. **Near doubles** — 6+7 is double 6 plus 1 = 13
5. **Make 10 strategy** — 8+5 = 8+2+3 = 10+3 = 13

#### Practice Tools

| Tool | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Cuisenaire rods** | Physical | Best manipulative for understanding number relationships |
| **Ten frames** | Physical/printable | Essential for understanding numbers to 20 |
| **Number line** | Physical | Stick one on the wall, refer to it constantly |
| **Rekenrek** (abacus-like) | Physical | Visual representation of 10s and 1s |
| **Mathletics** | Online | Excellent Australian online maths program |
| **Prodigy Math** | Online game | Free, game-based maths practice |

### Place Value Understanding

This is the **foundation of all future maths.** Invest time here.

- Use bundles of 10 paddle-pop sticks
- "The number 34 means 3 tens and 4 ones"
- MAB blocks (Multibase Arithmetic Blocks) — available at all school supply stores
- Expanded notation: 34 = 30 + 4

### Word Problems

Start with simple, real-life word problems:
- "You have 8 grapes. I give you 5 more. How many do you have?"
- "There were 12 birds. 4 flew away. How many are left?"

**Key skill:** Learn to identify the **operation** (add or subtract) from the words.

## 💡 Parent Tips for Year 1

### Building a Reading Habit
- **20 minutes of reading per day** is the magic number (research shows massive vocabulary gains)
- Let him choose books — even if they seem "too easy" — re-reading builds fluency
- Audiobooks in the car count as literacy! Try *Roald Dahl* audiobooks, *Treehouse* series
- **Ask comprehension questions** while reading to him:
  - "What do you think will happen next?"
  - "Why did the character do that?"
  - "How would you feel if that happened to you?"

### Building Maths Confidence
- **Maths is everywhere** — cooking, shopping, travel times, counting change
- "Let's split the pizza equally — how many slices each?"
- "We need to leave in 30 minutes. What time will that be?"
- Don't say "I was never good at maths" — growth mindset for parents too!
