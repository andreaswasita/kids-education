## 🎯 How to Track Progress

### Daily — Quick mental check:
- Did we read together today? ✅
- Did we do phonics/maths? ✅
- Was it fun? ✅ (If not, change the activity)

### Weekly — Friday review:
- How many new letter sounds does he know?
- Can he blend words we practised this week?
- What book are we reading at bedtime?

### Monthly — Update the [Progress Tracker](../tracking/progress-tracker.md):
- Tick off mastered skills
- Note areas that need more practice
- Adjust the schedule if needed

## 💡 Golden Rules

1. **Never force it.** If he's tired or frustrated, stop. Try again tomorrow.
2. **Keep it under 15 minutes per activity.** Short bursts beat long slogs.
3. **Read aloud every single night.** This is non-negotiable. It's the highest-impact activity.
4. **Play IS learning.** LEGO, puzzles, blocks, and board games all count.
5. **Talk to him constantly.** Narrate your day, ask questions, expand vocabulary.
6. **Be consistent, not intense.** 7 hrs/week of gentle practice > 3 hrs of weekend cramming.
7. **Celebrate everything.** First word read? Party. Counted to 20? High five. Wrong answer? "Great try, let's figure it out."
